# Ph.D. thesis template

This is a simple thesis template, I used for my final Ph.D. thesis.
It is not fancy and just uses a minimum of packages.
In the first pace, this made to create a version that is viewed on a screen and not printed.

## Issue

There are some issues. I am happy if you can help fix them.

* The "chapterabstract" environment should not have any indent in the first line, but there is a little one.
